    "instructions": "# Character Sheet\r This is a character sheet for the german rpg ABOREA. It was inspired by the Pathfinder character sheet of the roll20 community. At this time the only available language is german. However if there is a need for this sheet in another language, please let me know.\r\r##  Adjustments\r Unfortunately in this first version of the character sheet you have to make some adjustments to get the full potential of the sheet:\r\r* Autocalculation fields: for the autocalculation you need the \"Aborea Character Sheet AutoCalculations.js\" to run (roll20 PRO user only). If you are a no PRO user at roll20 you can set the fields that are normally calculated manually at the last red tab in the sheet by yourself.\r* Creating rollable tables: At this time the character sheet uses rollable tables for some chat outputs (the html-code of the sheet refers to those specific tables). To use the roll buttons for skills in the sheet you need to create a rollable table for each skill. Each rollable table has to be named after the skill (case sensitive) and has to have at least one item (a string, which defines the chatbox output for when the skill is used). If you encounter any problems by setting up the rollable tables, please let me know and I'll try to help you."
